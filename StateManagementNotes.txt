State Management
-----------------
What is State Mgt?
State Mgt is a technique to pass data from one page to another page.

Why State Mgt?
As web applications use http/https as a protocol, these protocols are stateless, ie they donot keep the previous request data with them, we have 
to explicity use some techniques to remember the data of the previous request, so we use state mgt.

State Management Techniques:

a) Client Side State Mgt: The data be stored on the client side, then we use client side state mgt techniques
   1) ViewState: Whenever the data is to be passed from one control to another ON THE SAME PAGE.
		It is a property of the control that uses StateBag to store the information about the control.
            It is property which brings the data across round trips to the server.


   2) Cookies: Whenever the data is to be passed between the pages.
		A cookie file is a text file to store the data

       Persisted
		----------------------------------------------------
		*This may be used to store data on the client side with a limit.
	        *60 cookies per domain and the total size(across all cookies) should be less than or equal to 4093 bytes.
	        *Chrome browser not more than 400 days.
		*Cookies need to be enabled in the browser

   3) QueryString: Whenever the data is to be passed between the pages.
		The data is seen in the address bar/url of the browser. So sensitive data gets exposed.
      The query string limit is 2048 bytes.

  

b) Server Side State Mgt: The data be stored on the server side, then we use server side state mgt techniques
   1) Session: Per User ----Private
   2) Application: Per Application---Global/Public
